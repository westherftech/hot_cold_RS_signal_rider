# hot_cold_RS_signal_rider
A script for measuring the equivalent noise temperature using the hot load / cold load measurements using the Rohde &amp; Schwarz signal rider.

Test setup - The signal rider is connected via an ethernet cable directly to the computer running this script with both set to static IP address.

For my test, the test computer was manually set to 10.28.1.206 and the spectrum analyser was manually set to 10.28.1.205.
